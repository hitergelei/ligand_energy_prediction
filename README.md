This codebase implements the polarizable atom interaction neural network (PaiNN) model for the energy predictions of small molecules, then uses the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method to predict reaction pathways using the trained model.  
All code is implement in a Jupyter notebook per the instructions for the course project.
